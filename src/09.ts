/*
  The elves are playing with a magical train ðŸš‚ that carries gifts. This train moves on a board represented by an array of strings.

  The train consists of an engine (@), followed by its carriages (o), and must collect magical fruits (*) which serve as fuel. The movement of the train follows these rules:

  You will receive two parameters board and mov.

  board is an array of strings that represents the board:

  @ is the train's engine.
  o are the train's carriages.
  * is a magical fruit.
  Â· are empty spaces.
  mov is a string that indicates the next movement of the train from the train's head @:

  'L': left
  'R': right
  'U': up
  'D': down.
  With this information, you must return a string:

  'crash': If the train crashes into the edges of the board or itself.
  'eat': If the train collects a magical fruit (*).
  'none': If it moves without crashing or collecting any magical fruit.
  Example:

  const board = [
    'Â·Â·Â·Â·Â·',
    '*Â·Â·Â·Â·',
    '@Â·Â·Â·Â·',
    'oÂ·Â·Â·Â·',
    'oÂ·Â·Â·Â·'
  ]

  console.log(moveTrain(board, 'U'))
  // âžž 'eat'
  // Because the train moves up and finds a magical fruit

  console.log(moveTrain(board, 'D'))
  // âžž 'crash'
  // The train moves down and the head crashes into itself

  console.log(moveTrain(board, 'L'))
  // âžž 'crash'
  // The train moves to the left and crashes into the wall

  console.log(moveTrain(board, 'R'))
  // âžž 'none'
  // The train moves to the right and there is empty space on the right
 */

type Movement = 'U' | 'D' | 'R' | 'L'
type Result = 'none' | 'crash' | 'eat'

  const trainHead = [0, 0]

  for (let i = 0; i < board.length; i++) {
    for (let j = 0; j < board[i].length; j++) {
      if (board[i][j] === '@') {
        trainHead[0] = i
        trainHead[1] = j
      }
    }
  }

  if (mov === 'U') {

  } else if (mov === 'D') {

  } else if (mov === 'L') {
    trainHead[1] -= 1
  } else if (mov === 'R') {
